# cmd_test

Here is my testing project, which I will code anything for testing any thing. Such as from *basic flag technique (using shift)*, *display int value in binary format*, *string processing*, etc... to the complex function which I need for a specific problem in a specific project.

**Java**

Java is the language I used in this project.
